# About Automatos AI

Automatos AI is an advanced AI orchestration platform designed to unify **symbolic reasoning**, **neural processing**, and **quantum semantics** into one production-ready framework.

## Key Differentiators

- **Mathematical Foundations** — Context assembly based on the formula `C = A(c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆)`.
- **Research Validated** — Performance improvements inspired by IBM Zurich, Princeton ICML, Indiana University, and Singapore-MIT.
- **Production Ready** — Multi-modal RAG, code similarity search, project context awareness, execution pattern learning.

## Example Use Cases

- Automated code review with deep context awareness.
- Customer support bots that adapt tone based on previous interactions.
- Data analysis agents orchestrating complex workflows.
